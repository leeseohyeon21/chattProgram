## Chatting Program

this program is example in book.<br>
you check this book below <strong>reference</strong><br>

I followed with and dockerized that completed program
docker image is in https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/leeseohyeon21/chat

My challenge is that implement it in docker swarm mode and make each docker machine's container communicate.<br>
but it doesn't work well yet.<br>
